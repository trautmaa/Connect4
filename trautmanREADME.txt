Connect 4 Game: Final project for CS 111-03
Andy Exley

My final project is a working connect 4 game between the user and an artificial intelligence program. As far as I can tell, the game has no bugs. 

To run: download graph.py, connect4.py and graphics.py into the same directory. Find that directory in terminal and run graph.py

List of features:
-working artificial intelligence
-graphics display
-quit button
-piece color labels
-yellow line connecting the 4 pieces which won the game
-use of custom coordinates to ease with graphics - window size is easily modifiable
-use of objects and functions
-announces winner (in color of winner's pieces) after game ends
-window closes with a final mouse click

Enjoy!
